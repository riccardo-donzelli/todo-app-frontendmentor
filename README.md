## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I have learned how to drag and drop list elements, how to change icon for a dark theme switch,
and I came up with a solution to count only the active elements inside the todo list, that change instantly when you add a new element, you cancel and old one or you click on and old one to mark it as "completed".
I also learned how to set a local storage to keep data after the user closes the browser, so the user will be able to see the todo list as he/she updated it before when he/she will reopen
the browser later.
